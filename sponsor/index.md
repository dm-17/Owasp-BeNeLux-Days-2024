OWASP chapter Meetings & Events are the heartbeat of the application and product security 
community, aimed to spread knowledge and learn from each other.

The local Chapters of OWASP in The Netherlands and Belgium come together every year to 
host a physical event called “**OWASP BeNeLux Days**” which this year is happening in the 
heart of the City of Utrecht in the Netherlands. It brings together a wide range of 
security technologists, from executives to individual contributors across SMBs and major 
corporations.These are important influencers and decision makers who drive the buying 
decisions for investments in security. 

This event presents sponsors with a unique opportunity to elevate their brand visibility 
among a select group of influential individuals through our competitive sponsorship packages.

We would be proud to work alongside and partner with vendors and organizations
who believe in our mission to educate, inspire, and spread security awareness. Your
support for our event will not only align and recognize your **brand** with key
influencers, our community but also resonate with thousands of **potential customers**.
By sponsoring our event, your message will be strategically tailored to engage with
specific personas within our community who are active contributors and participants.
This targeted approach ensures that your brand receives maximum exposure and
recognition among our audience, ultimately driving demand and boosting brand
awareness.

Our sponsorship packages are designed to provide sponsors with maximum exposure
and engagement, allowing them to showcase their brand in a compelling and impactful
way.

OWASP globally has established strategic relationships with many major media
groups worldwide and in BeNeLux, focused on IT security—print publications,
newsletters, portals, consultants, associations, and user groups. Your message—and
leadership positioning—reaches thousands of prospects before you even arrive at
OWASP events.

Please know that due to the high-profile nature of our non-profit organization, limited
sponsorship opportunities are available and sell rapidly - so we urge you to act quickly!
We would love to welcome you and your organization and hope to see you at the
event!

**All proceeds from sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation
(represented in Europe by OWASP Europe VZW, non-profit under Belgian Law).
Supporting these events drives the funding for research grants, tools and documents,
local chapters, and more.**

## About the Event

Each year, our chapters organize regular meetings featuring high-quality speakers and
panel discussions. These meetings typically attract an average of 80 attendees.
Furthermore, we directly communicate our chapter meetings to 1500 security
practitioners in Belgium and the Netherlands.

In 2024, the OWASP BeNeLux event returns on Thursday, November 28, and Friday,
November 29, in Utrecht, Netherlands. Hosted at **Jaarbeurs** in **Utrecht**, OWASP
BeNeLux 2024 spans two full days, featuring hands-on OWASP Training and a
Conference with a lineup of esteemed local and international speakers addressing
OWASP and security topics.

Previous editions attracted over 200 attendees from Belgium and The Netherlands,
hosted at venues such as the University of Leuven, CORDA in Hasselt, the RAI in
Amsterdam, and the University of Luxembourg. For 2024, we aim to exceed 250
attendees.

Your sponsorship will directly support our chapter meetings, covering speaker fees
and catering expenses. Additionally, it will contribute to the costs associated with
organizing the OWASP 2024 BeNeLux event.
